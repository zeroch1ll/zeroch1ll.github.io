# ABOUT THIS BLOG

I created this blog to document and share the things I am learning, working on, and generally thinking about in the scope of offensive security and red teaming. Much of what I'll be posting about likely won't be very novel; the point is rather to translate what I'm learning into information that might also be able to help others in their offsec journey. Teaching is also one of the best ways of learning. 

This is also a way for me to interact with and hopefully contribue to the broader offensive security industry. To that end, please don't hesitate to reach out to correct innaccuracies (I am _always_ seeking out constructive feedback and criticism), ask a question, or just generally to connect!

Topics will include development in C++, Windows Internals, DevOps, *nix Internals, Evasion, and general pen testing stuff.

# ABOUT ME

My name is Stephen Miller and I am a red teamer and offensive security engineer. I have experience on both internal teams and consulting in varying capacities. I love learning new things and exploring technical skills, in cyberspace and in meatspace.

Things I love but you will _not_ see me write about: cooking, combat sports, heavy music, my dog, non-technical non-fiction and fiction books, and shooting.
